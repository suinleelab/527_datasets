# CSE 527 Data Portal

Welcome to CSE 527 (Computational Biology)! To help everyone
brainstorm final project ideas, we've provided some sample
datasets that have previously been used in high impact
computational biology publications.

The repository is organized as follows: each top-level folder
represents a data modality (e.g. gene expression data), with each
subfolder corresponding to a specific dataset. Each dataset folder
contains a single Jupyter notebook. This notebook provides a high
level description of the dataset, and then walks through the process
of downloading the dataset and performing any necessary preprocessing.

Ideally, the notebooks are meant to encapsulate the _whole_ process of
obtaining/cleaning the dataset (i.e., the notebook should download
any files rather than forcing the use to do it externally). However, due to
restrictions on data sharing for some datasets, you may need to download the
files yourself from another source.

Please reach out to the TAs with any questions! If you're looking for a specific
kind of data but can't find it here, we're more than happy to help.
